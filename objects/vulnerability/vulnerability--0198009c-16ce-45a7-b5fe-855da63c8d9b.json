            "description": "In Stormshield Network Security (SNS) 3.7.6 through 3.7.24, 3.11.1 through 3.11.12, 4.2.1 through 4.2.9, and 4.3.0 through 4.3.4, a flood of connections to the SSLVPN service might lead to saturation of the loopback interface. This could result in the blocking of almost all network traffic, making the firewall unreachable. An attacker could exploit this via forged and properly timed traffic to cause a denial of service.",
