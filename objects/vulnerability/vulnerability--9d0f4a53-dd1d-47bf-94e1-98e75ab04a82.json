            "description": "A missing authorization vulnerability in the web management interface of FatPipe WARP, IPVPN, and MPVPN software prior to versions 10.1.2r60p91 and 10.2.2r42 allows a remote attacker to access at least the URL \"/fpui/jsp/index.jsp\" leading to unknown impact, presumably some violation of confidentiality. Older versions of FatPipe software may also be vulnerable. The FatPipe advisory identifier for this vulnerability is FPSA004.",
