            "description": "The TRENDnet TI-PG1284i switch(hw v2.0R) prior to version 2.0.2.S0 suffers from an integer underflow vulnerability. This vulnerability exists in its lldp related component. Due to lack of proper validation on length field of ChassisID TLV, by sending a crafted lldp packet to the device, integer underflow would occur and the negative number will be passed to memcpy() later, which may cause buffer overflow or invalid memory access.",
