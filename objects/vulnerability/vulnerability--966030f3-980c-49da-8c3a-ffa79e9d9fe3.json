            "description": "LibreOffice supports digital signatures of ODF documents and macros within documents, presenting visual aids that no alteration of the document occurred since the last signing and that the signature is valid. An Improper Certificate Validation vulnerability in LibreOffice allowed an attacker to create a digitally signed ODF document, by manipulating the documentsignatures.xml or macrosignatures.xml stream within the document to combine multiple certificate data, which when opened caused LibreOffice to display a validly signed indicator but whose content was unrelated to the signature shown. This issue affects: The Document Foundation LibreOffice 7-0 versions prior to 7.0.6; 7-1 versions prior to 7.1.2.",
