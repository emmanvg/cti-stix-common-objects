            "description": "An issue was discovered in Blue Prism Enterprise 6.0 through 7.01. In a misconfigured environment that exposes the Blue Prism Application server, it is possible for an authenticated user to reverse engineer the Blue Prism software and circumvent access controls for the getChartData administrative function. Using a low/no privilege Blue Prism user account, the attacker can alter the server's settings by abusing the getChartData method, allowing the Blue Prism server to execute any MSSQL stored procedure by name.",
