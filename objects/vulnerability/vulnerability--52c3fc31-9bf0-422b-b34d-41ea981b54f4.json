So from Apache Struts 2.0.0 to 2.5.29, still some of the tagâ€™s attributes could perform a double evaluation if a developer applied forced OGNL evaluation by using the %{...} syntax. Using forced OGNL evaluation on untrusted user input can lead to a Remote Code Execution and security degradation.",
