            "description": "An exploitable return of stack variable address vulnerability exists in the JavaScript implementation of Nitro Pro PDF. A specially crafted document can cause a stack variable to go out of scope, resulting in the application dereferencing a stale pointer. This can lead to code execution under the context of the application. An attacker can convince a user to open a document to trigger the vulnerability.",
