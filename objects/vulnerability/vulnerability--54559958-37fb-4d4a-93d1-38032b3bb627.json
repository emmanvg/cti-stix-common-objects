            "description": "JupyterLab is a user interface for Project Jupyter which will eventually replace the classic Jupyter Notebook. In affected versions untrusted notebook can execute code on load. In particular JupyterLab doesnâ€™t sanitize the action attribute of html `<form>`. Using this it is possible to trigger the form validation outside of the form itself. This is a remote code execution, but requires user action to open a notebook.",
