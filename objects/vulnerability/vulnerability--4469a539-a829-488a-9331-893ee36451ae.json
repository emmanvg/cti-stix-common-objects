            "description": "Rockwell Automation ISaGRAF Workbench software versions 6.0 through 6.6.9 are affected by a Deserialization of Untrusted Data vulnerability. ISaGRAF Workbench does not limit the objects that can be deserialized. This vulnerability allows attackers to craft a malicious serialized object that, if opened by a local user in ISaGRAF Workbench, may result in remote code execution. This vulnerability requires user interaction to be successfully exploited.",
