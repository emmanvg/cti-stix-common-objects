            "description": "Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort vulnerability exists in ClearSCADA (all versions), EcoStruxure Geo SCADA Expert 2019 (all versions), and EcoStruxure Geo SCADA Expert 2020 (V83.7742.1 and prior), which could cause the revealing of account credentials when server database files are available. Exposure of these files to an attacker can make the system vulnerable to password decryption attacks. Note that “.sde” configuration export files do not contain user account password hashes.",
