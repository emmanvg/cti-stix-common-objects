Another endpoint mapped by the tiny url, was one for reservation cancellation, containing the MongoDB ID of the reservation, and organization. This can be used to query the http://tgm-api.tabit.cloud/rsv/management/{reservationId}?organization={orgId} API which returns a lot of data regarding the reservation (OWASP: API3): Name, mail, phone number, the number of visits of the user to this specific restaurant, the money he spent there, the money he spent on alcohol, whether he left a deposit etc. This information can easily be used for a phishing attack.",
