            "description": "PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE. In versions 2.11.1 and prior, parsing an incoming SIP message that contains a malformed multipart can potentially cause out-of-bound read access. This issue affects all PJSIP users that accept SIP multipart. The patch is available as commit  in the `master` branch. There are no known workarounds.",
