            "description": "BigBlueButton is an open source web conferencing system. In affected versions an attacker can embed malicious JS in their username and have it executed on the victim's client. When a user receives a private chat from the attacker (whose username contains malicious JavaScript), the script gets executed. Additionally when the victim receives a notification that the attacker has left the session. This issue has been patched in version 2.4.8 and 2.5.0. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
