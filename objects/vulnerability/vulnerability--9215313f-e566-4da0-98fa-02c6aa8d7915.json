            "description": "Mercurius is a GraphQL adapter for Fastify. Any users from Mercurius@8.10.0 to 8.11.1 are subjected to a denial of service attack by sending a malformed JSON to `/graphql` unless they are using a custom error handler. The vulnerability has been fixed in https://github.com/mercurius-js/mercurius/pull/678 and shipped as v8.11.2. As a workaround users may use a custom error handler.",
