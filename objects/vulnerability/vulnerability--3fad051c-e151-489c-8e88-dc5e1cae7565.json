            "description": "A vulnerability has been identified in Siveillance Video Open Network Bridge (2020 R3), Siveillance Video Open Network Bridge (2020 R2), Siveillance Video Open Network Bridge (2020 R1), Siveillance Video Open Network Bridge (2019 R3), Siveillance Video Open Network Bridge (2019 R2), Siveillance Video Open Network Bridge (2019 R1), Siveillance Video Open Network Bridge (2018 R3), Siveillance Video Open Network Bridge (2018 R2). Affected Open Network Bridges store user credentials for the authentication between ONVIF clients and ONVIF server using a hard-coded key. The encrypted credentials can be retrieved via the MIP SDK. This could allow an authenticated remote attacker to retrieve and decrypt all credentials stored on the ONVIF server.",
