            "description": "Emissary is a distributed, peer-to-peer, data-driven workflow framework. Emissary 6.4.0 is vulnerable to Unsafe Deserialization of post-authenticated requests to the [`WorkSpaceClientEnqueue.action`](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/emissary/blob/30c54ef16c6eb6ed09604a929939fb9f66868382/src/main/java/emissary/server/mvc/internal/WorkSpaceClientEnqueueAction.java) REST endpoint. This issue may lead to post-auth Remote Code Execution. This issue has been patched in version 6.5.0. As a workaround, one can disable network access to Emissary from untrusted sources.",
