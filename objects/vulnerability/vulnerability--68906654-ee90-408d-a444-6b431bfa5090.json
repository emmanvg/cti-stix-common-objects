            "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of NIKON NIS-Elements Viewer 1.2100.1483.0. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of TIF images. Crafted data in a TIF file can trigger a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
