            "description": "In ASUS RT-AX3000, ZenWiFi AX (XT8), RT-AX88U, and other ASUS routers with firmware < 3.0.0.4.386.42095 or < 9.0.0.4.386.41994, when IPv6 is used, a routing loop can occur that generates excessive network traffic between an affected device and its upstream ISP's router. This occurs when a link prefix route points to a point-to-point link, a destination IPv6 address belongs to the prefix and is not a local IPv6 address, and a router advertisement is received with at least one global unique IPv6 prefix for which the on-link flag is set.",
