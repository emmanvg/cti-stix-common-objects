            "description": "Vyper is a pythonic smart contract language for the ethereum virtual machine. Since version 0.3.2, decimals use the full range of the underlying int168 type. multiplication of 168 bit integers can wrap in 256-bit arithmetic, but safemul does not check for that. This has been patched in v0.3.4. There are no known workarounds for this issue.",
