User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of JT files. Crafted data in a JT file can trigger a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
