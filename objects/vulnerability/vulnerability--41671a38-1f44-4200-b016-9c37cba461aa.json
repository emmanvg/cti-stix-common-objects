            "description": "A vulnerability in the Layer 2 punt code of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to cause a queue wedge on an interface that receives specific Layer 2 frames, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to improper handling of certain Layer 2 frames. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending specific Layer 2 frames on the segment the router is connected to. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a queue wedge on the interface, resulting in a DoS condition.",
