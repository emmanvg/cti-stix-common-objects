            "description": "In the Elementor Website Builder WordPress plugin before 3.1.4, the column element (includes/elements/column.php) accepts an ‘html_tag’ parameter. Although the element control lists a fixed set of possible html tags, it is possible for a user with Contributor or above permissions to send a modified ‘save_builder’ request containing JavaScript in the ‘html_tag’ parameter, which is not filtered and is output without escaping. This JavaScript will then be executed when the saved page is viewed or previewed.",
