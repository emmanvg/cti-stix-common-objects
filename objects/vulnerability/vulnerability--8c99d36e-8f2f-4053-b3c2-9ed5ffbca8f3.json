In affected versions it is possible to load PHP files by entering insert tags in the Contao back end. Installations are only affected if they have untrusted back end users who have the rights to modify fields that are shown in the front end. Update to Contao 4.4.56, 4.9.18 or 4.11.7 to resolve. If you cannot update then disable the login for untrusted back end users.",
