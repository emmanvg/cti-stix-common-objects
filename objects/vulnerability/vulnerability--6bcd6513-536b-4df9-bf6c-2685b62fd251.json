            "description": "### Description Envoy does not decode escaped slash sequences `%2F` and `%5C` in HTTP URL paths in versions 1.18.2 and before. A remote attacker may craft a path with escaped slashes, e.g. `/something%2F..%2Fadmin`, to bypass access control, e.g. a block on `/admin`. A backend server could then decode slash sequences and normalize path and provide an attacker access beyond the scope provided for by the access control policy. ### Impact Escalation of Privileges when using RBAC or JWT filters with enforcement based on URL path. Users with back end servers that interpret `%2F` and `/` and `%5C` and `\\` interchangeably are impacted. ### Attack Vector URL paths containing escaped slash characters delivered by untrusted client. ### Patches Envoy versions 1.18.3, 1.17.3, 1.16.4, 1.15.5 contain new path normalization option to decode escaped slash characters. ### Workarounds If back end servers treat `%2F` and `/` and `%5C` and `\\` interchangeably and a URL path based access control is configured, we recommend reconfiguring back end server to not treat `%2F` and `/` and `%5C` and `\\` interchangeably if feasible. ### Credit Ruilin Yang (ruilin.yrl@gmail.com) ### References https://blog.envoyproxy.io https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/releases ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [Envoy repo](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues) * Email us at [envoy-security](mailto:envoy-security@googlegroups.com)",
