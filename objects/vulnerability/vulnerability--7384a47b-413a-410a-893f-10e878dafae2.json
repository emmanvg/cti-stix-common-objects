            "description": "The Stockists Manager for Woocommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.0.2.1. This is due to missing nonce validation on the stockist_settings_main() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
