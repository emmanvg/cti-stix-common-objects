            "description": "The io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel allowed the MAX_RW_COUNT limit to be bypassed in the PROVIDE_BUFFERS operation, which led to negative values being usedin mem_rw when reading /proc/<PID>/mem. This could be used to create a heap overflow leading to arbitrary code execution in the kernel. It was addressed via commit d1f82808877b (\"io_uring: truncate lengths larger than MAX_RW_COUNT on provide buffers\") (v5.13-rc1) and backported to the stable kernels in v5.12.4, v5.11.21, and v5.10.37. It was introduced in ddf0322db79c (\"io_uring: add IORING_OP_PROVIDE_BUFFERS\") (v5.7-rc1).",
