            "description": "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists when reading a DGN file using Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK before 2022.11. The specific issue exists within the parsing of DGN files. Crafted data in a DGN file and lack of proper validation for the XFAT sectors count can trigger a write operation past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
