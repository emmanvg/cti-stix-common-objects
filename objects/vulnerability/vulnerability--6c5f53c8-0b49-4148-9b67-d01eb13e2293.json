            "description": "A vulnerability in an access control mechanism of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access services beyond the scope of their authorization. This vulnerability is due to insufficient enforcement of access control in the affected software. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by directly accessing the internal services of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overwrite policies and impact the configuration and operation of the affected device.",
