Crafted malicious files can allow an attacker to traverse the file system when opened by ISaGRAF Workbench. If successfully exploited, an attacker could overwrite existing files and create additional files with the same permissions of the ISaGRAF Workbench software. User interaction is required for this exploit to be successful.",
