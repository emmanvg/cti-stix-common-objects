            "description": "CyberArk Identity 21.5.131, when handling an invalid authentication attempt, sometimes reveals whether the username is valid. In certain authentication policy configurations with MFA, the API response length can be used to differentiate between a valid user and an invalid one (aka Username Enumeration). Response differentiation enables attackers to enumerate usernames of valid application users. Attackers can use this information to leverage brute-force and dictionary attacks in order to discover valid account information such as passwords.",
