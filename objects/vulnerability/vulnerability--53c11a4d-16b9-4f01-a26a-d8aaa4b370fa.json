            "description": "\r A vulnerability in the NX-API feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.\r The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of user supplied data that is sent to the NX-API. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the NX-API of an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands with root privileges on the underlying operating system.\r Note: The NX-API feature is disabled by default.\r ",
