This vulnerability is due to incorrect handling of certain crafted software images that are uploaded to the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating to the system as an administrative user and then uploading specific crafted software images to the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system as the root user.",
