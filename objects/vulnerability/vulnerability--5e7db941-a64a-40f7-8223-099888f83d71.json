            "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Prime Service Catalog could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive information on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper enforcement of Administrator privilege levels for low-value sensitive data. An attacker with read-only Administrator access to the web-based management interface could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious HTTP request to the page that contains the sensitive data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to collect sensitive information about users of the system and orders that have been placed using the application.",
