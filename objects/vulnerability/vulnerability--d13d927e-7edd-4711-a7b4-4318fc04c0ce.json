            "description": "SAP Manufacturing Execution (System Rules), versions - 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, allows an authorized attacker to embed malicious code into HTTP parameter and send it to the server because SAP Manufacturing Execution (System Rules) tab does not sufficiently encode some parameters, resulting in Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The malicious code can be used for different purposes. e.g., information can be read, modified, and sent to the attacker. However, availability of the server cannot be impacted.",
