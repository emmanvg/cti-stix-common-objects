            "description": "wire-webapp is the web application interface for the wire messaging service. Insufficient escaping in markdown “code highlighting” in the wire-webapp resulted in the possibility of injecting and executing arbitrary HTML code and thus also JavaScript. If a user receives and views such a malicious message, arbitrary code is injected and executed in the context of the victim. This allows the attacker to fully control the user account. Wire-desktop clients that are connected to a vulnerable wire-webapp version are also vulnerable to this attack. The issue has been fixed in wire-webapp 2022-03-30-production.0 and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. On-premise instances of wire-webapp need to be updated to docker tag 2022-03-30-production.0-v0.29.2-0-d144552 or wire-server 2022-03-30 (chart/4.8.0), so that their applications are no longer affected. There are no known workarounds for this issue. ### Patches * The issue has been fixed in wire-webapp **2022-03-30-production.0** and is already deployed on all Wire managed services. * On-premise instances of wire-webapp need to be updated to docker tag **2022-03-30-production.0-v0.29.2-0-d144552** or wire-server **2022-03-30 (chart/4.8.0)**, so that their applications are no longer affected. ### Workarounds * No workarounds known ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory feel free to email us at [vulnerability-report@wire.com](mailto:vulnerability-report@wire.com) ### Credits We thank [Posix](https://twitter.com/po6ix) for reporting this vulnerability",
