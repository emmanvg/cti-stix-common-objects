Versions prior to 4.11 do not properly neutralize user input used in user name and language fields. Due to this improper neutralization it is possible to perform cross-site scripting via these fields. The issues were fixed in the 4.11 release. Users unable to upgrade are advised to add their own neutralize logic.",
