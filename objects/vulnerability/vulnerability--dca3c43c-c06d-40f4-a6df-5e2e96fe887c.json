            "description": "A Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime vulnerability in the Packet Forwarding Engine (PFE) of Juniper Networks Junos OS on PTX Series allows an adjacent attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending genuine BGP flowspec packets which cause an FPC heap memory leak. Once having run out of memory the FPC will crash and restart along with a core dump. Continued receipted of these packets will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition. This issue affects: Juniper Networks Junos OS All versions prior to 18.4R3-S9; 19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S7; 19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S7, 19.2R3-S3; 19.3 versions prior to 19.3R2-S6, 19.3R3-S3; 19.4 versions prior to 19.4R1-S4, 19.4R3-S6; 20.1 versions prior to 20.1R2-S2, 20.1R3; 20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S1; 20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2.
