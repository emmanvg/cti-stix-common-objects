The subtitle is stored as a custom post meta with the key: \"wps_subtitle\", which is sanitized upon post save/update, however is not sanitized when updating it directly from the post meta update button (via AJAX) - and this makes the XSS exploitable by authenticated users with a role as low as contributor.",
