            "description": "This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Sante DICOM Viewer Pro 11.8.7.0. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DCM files. The issue results from the lack of validating the existence of an object prior to performing operations on the object. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. Was ZDI-CAN-15100.",
