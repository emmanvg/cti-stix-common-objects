            "description": "A Reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in McAfee Policy Auditor prior to 6.5.2 allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the UID request parameter. The malicious script is reflected unmodified into the Policy Auditor web-based interface which could lead to the extract of end user session token or login credentials. These may be used to access additional security-critical applications or conduct arbitrary cross-domain requests.",
