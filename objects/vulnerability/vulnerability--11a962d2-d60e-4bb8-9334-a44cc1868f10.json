            "description": "A stack-based Buffer Overflow vulnerability in Juniper Networks SBR Carrier with EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) authentication configured, allows an attacker sending specific packets causing the radius daemon to crash resulting with a Denial of Service (DoS) or leading to remote code execution (RCE). By continuously sending this specific packets, an attacker can repeatedly crash the radius daemon, causing a sustained Denial of Service (DoS). This issue affects Juniper Networks SBR Carrier: 8.4.1 versions prior to 8.4.1R19; 8.5.0 versions prior to 8.5.0R10; 8.6.0 versions prior to 8.6.0R4.",
