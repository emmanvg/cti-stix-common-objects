This could lead to untrusted or unauthorized sessions being established, resulting in an impact on confidentiality or stability of the network. This issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved: All versions prior to 20.3R2-S1-EVO; 20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-EVO; 21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-EVO.
