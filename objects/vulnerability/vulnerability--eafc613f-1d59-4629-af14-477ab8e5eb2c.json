            "description": "A vulnerability in the NETISR network queue functionality of Juniper Networks Junos OS kernel allows an attacker to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by sending crafted genuine packets to a device.  During an attack, the routing protocol daemon (rpd) CPU may reach 100% utilization, yet FPC CPUs forwarding traffic will operate normally. This attack occurs when the attackers' packets are sent over an IPv4 unicast routing equal-cost multi-path (ECMP) unilist selection.\n\nContinued receipt and processing of these packets will create a sustained Denial of Service (DoS) condition.\n\nAn indicator of compromise may be to monitor NETISR drops in the network with the assistance of JTAC. Please contact JTAC for technical support for further guidance.\nThis issue affects:\nJuniper Networks Junos OS\n17.3 version 17.3R3-S9 and later versions prior to 17.3R3-S12;\n17.4 version 17.4R3-S3 and later versions prior to 17.4R3-S5;\n18.1 version 18.1R3-S11 and later versions prior to 18.1R3-S13;\n18.2 version 18.2R3-S6 and later versions;\n18.3 version 18.3R3-S4 and later versions prior to 18.3R3-S5;\n18.4 version 18.4R3-S5 and later versions prior to 18.4R3-S9;\n19.1 version 19.1R3-S3 and later versions prior to 19.1R3-S7.\n\nThis issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 17.3R3-S9.\n\nThis issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS Evolved.",
