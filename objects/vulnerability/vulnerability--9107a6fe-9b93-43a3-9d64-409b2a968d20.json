            "description": "An Out-of-Bounds Read vulnerability exists when reading a U3D file using Open Design Alliance PRC SDK before 2022.11. The specific issue exists within the parsing of U3D files. Incorrect use of the LibJpeg source manager inside the U3D library, and crafted data in a U3D file, can trigger a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
