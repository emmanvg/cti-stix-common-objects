            "description": "SICK Visionary-S CX up version 5.21.2.29154R are vulnerable to an Inadequate Encryption Strength vulnerability concerning the internal SSH interface solely used by SICK for recovering returned devices. The use of weak ciphers make it easier for an attacker to break the security that protects information transmitted from the client to the SSH server, assuming the attacker has access to the network on which the device is connected. This can increase the risk that encryption will be compromised, leading to the exposure of sensitive user information and man-in-the-middle attacks.",
