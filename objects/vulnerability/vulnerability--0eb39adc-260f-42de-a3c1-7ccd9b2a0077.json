            "description": "Venice is a Clojure inspired sandboxed Lisp dialect with excellent Java interoperability. A partial path traversal issue exists within the functions `load-file` and `load-resource`. These functions can be limited to load files from a list of load paths.\n\nAssuming Venice has been configured with the load paths: `[ \"/Users/foo/resources\" ]` \n\nWhen passing **relative** paths to these two vulnerable functions everything is fine:\n`(load-resource \"test.png\")`   => loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\"\n`(load-resource \"../resources-alt/test.png\")`   => rejected, outside the load path\n\nWhen passing **absolute** paths to these two vulnerable functions Venice may return files outside the configured load paths:\n`(load-resource \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\")`   => loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources/test.png\"\n`(load-resource \"/Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png\")`   => loads the file \"/Users/foo/resources-alt/test.png\" !!!\nThe latter call suffers from the _Partial Path Traversal_ vulnerability.\n\nThis issueâ€™s scope is limited to absolute paths whose name prefix matches a load path. E.g. for a load-path `\"/Users/foo/resources\"`, the actor can cause loading a resource also from `\"/Users/foo/resources-alt\"`, but not from `\"/Users/foo/images\"`.\n\nVersions of Venice before and including v1.10.17 are affected by this issue. Upgrade to Venice >= 1.10.18, if you are on a version < 1.10.18. There are currently no known workarounds.",
