The affected component can be abused to execute the malicious software inserted by the attacker with the elevated privileges of the component. This vulnerability results from a lack of access restrictions on certain files and/or folders in the installation. Affected releases are TIBCO Software Inc.'s TIBCO Messaging - Eclipse Mosquitto Distribution - Bridge - Community Edition: versions 1.3.0 and below and TIBCO Messaging - Eclipse Mosquitto Distribution - Bridge - Enterprise Edition: versions 1.3.0 and below.",
