            "description": "A vulnerability in the interprocess communication (IPC) channel of Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to overwrite VPN profiles on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted IPC message to the AnyConnect process. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to modify VPN profile files. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must have valid credentials on the affected system.",
