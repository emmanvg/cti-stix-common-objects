            "description": "The WooCommerce Upload Files WordPress plugin before 59.4 ran a single sanitization pass to remove blocked extensions such as .php. It was possible to bypass this and upload a file with a PHP extension by embedding a \"blocked\" extension within another \"blocked\" extension in the \"wcuf_file_name\" parameter. It was also possible to perform a double extension attack and upload files to a different location via path traversal using the \"wcuf_current_upload_session_id\" parameter.",
