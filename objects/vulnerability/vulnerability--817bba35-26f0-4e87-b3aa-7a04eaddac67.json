            "description": "When parsing a file that is submitted to the DPDecoder service as a job, the R3D SDK will mistakenly skip over the assignment of a property containing an object referring to a UUID that was parsed from a frame within the video container. Upon destruction of the object that owns it, the uninitialized member will be dereferenced and then destroyed using the object’s virtual destructor. Due to the object property being uninitialized, this can result in dereferencing an arbitrary pointer for the object’s virtual method table, which can result in code execution under the context of the application.",
