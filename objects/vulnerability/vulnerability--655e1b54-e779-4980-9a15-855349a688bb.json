            "description": "An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the ARM SIGPAGE functionality of Linux Kernel v5.4.66 and v5.4.54. The latest version (5.11-rc4) seems to still be vulnerable. A userland application can read the contents of the sigpage, which can leak kernel memory contents. An attacker can read a processâ€™s memory at a specific offset to trigger this vulnerability. This was fixed in kernel releases: 4.14.222 4.19.177 5.4.99 5.10.17 5.11",
