            "description": "An Improper Locking vulnerability in the SIP ALG of Juniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series and SRX Series allows an unauthenticated networked attacker to cause a flowprocessing daemon (flowd) crash and thereby a Denial of Service (DoS). Continued receipt of these specific packets will cause a sustained Denial of Service condition.\n\nThis issue can occur in a scenario where the SIP ALG is enabled and specific SIP messages are being processed simultaneously.\nThis issue affects:\nJuniper Networks Junos OS on MX Series and SRX Series\n20.4 versions prior to 20.4R3-S1;\n21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-S2, 21.1R3;\n21.2 versions prior to 21.2R1-S2, 21.2R2;\n21.3 versions prior to 21.3R1-S1, 21.3R2.\n\nThis issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 20.4R1.",
