A cross-site request forgery vulnerability exists in versions prior to 12.10.5, and in versions 13.0 through 13.1. It's possible for forge an URL that, when accessed by an admin, will reset the password of any user in XWiki. The problem has been patched in XWiki 12.10.5 and 13.2RC1. As a workaround, it is possible to apply the patch manually by modifying the `register_macros.vm` template.",
