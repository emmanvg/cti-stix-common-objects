            "description": "A vulnerability in the CLI of Cisco StarOS could allow an authenticated, local attacker to elevate privileges on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of CLI commands. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted commands to the CLI. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the root user. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to have valid administrative credentials on an affected device.",
