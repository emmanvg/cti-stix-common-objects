            "description": "The FreeMind WP Browser plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including 1.2. This is due to missing nonce protection on the FreemindOptions() function found in the ~/freemind-wp-browser.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject malicious web scripts into the page, granted they can trick a site's administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.",
