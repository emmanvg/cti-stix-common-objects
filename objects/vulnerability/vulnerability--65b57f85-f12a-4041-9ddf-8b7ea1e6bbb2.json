The PlantSimCore.dll library lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing SPP files. This could result in a stack based buffer overflow, a different vulnerability than CVE-2021-27396. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-13290)",
