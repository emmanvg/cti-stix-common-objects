            "description": "A vulnerability in File Transfer Solution of Raonwiz could allow arbitrary command execution as the result of viewing a specially-crafted web page. This vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of the parameter of the specific method. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by setting the parameter to the command they want to execute. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on a target system as the user. However, the victim must run the Internet Explorer browser with administrator privileges because of the cross-domain policy.",
