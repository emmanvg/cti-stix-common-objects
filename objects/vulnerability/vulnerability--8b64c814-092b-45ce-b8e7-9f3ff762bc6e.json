            "description": "A vulnerability in the Clientless SSL VPN (WebVPN) component of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct browser-based attacks. This vulnerability is due to improper validation of input that is passed to the Clientless SSL VPN component. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by convincing a targeted user to visit a website that can pass malicious requests to an ASA device that has the Clientless SSL VPN feature enabled. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to conduct browser-based attacks, including cross-site scripting attacks, against the targeted user.",
