However, the extracted folders are not checked and it is possible to upload a zip which contained a directory with PHP file in it and then it is not removed from the disk. It is a bypass of CVE-2020-24948 which allows sending a PHP file via the \"Import Settings\" functionality to achieve Remote Code Execution.",
