            "description": "A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) punt handling function of Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to overload a device punt path, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to the punt path being overwhelmed by large quantities of SNMP requests. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large number of SNMP requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overload the device punt path, resulting in a DoS condition.",
