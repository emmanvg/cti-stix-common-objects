            "description": "Arbitrary PHP code execution vulnerability in Drupal Core under certain circumstances. An attacker could trick an administrator into visiting a malicious site that could result in creating a carefully named directory on the file system. With this directory in place, an attacker could attempt to brute force a remote code execution vulnerability. Windows servers are most likely to be affected. This issue affects: Drupal Drupal Core 8.8.x versions prior to 8.8.8; 8.9.x versions prior to 8.9.1; 9.0.1 versions prior to 9.0.1.",
