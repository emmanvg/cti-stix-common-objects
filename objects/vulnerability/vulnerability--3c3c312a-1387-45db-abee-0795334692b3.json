            "description": "An improper check for unusual or exceptional conditions vulnerability in Juniper Networks MX Series platforms with Trio-based MPC (Modular Port Concentrator) deployed in (Ethernet VPN) EVPN-(Virtual Extensible LAN) VXLAN configuration, may allow an attacker sending specific Layer 2 traffic to cause Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection to trigger unexpectedly, resulting in traffic impact. Continued receipt and processing of this specific Layer 2 frames will sustain the Denial of Service (DoS) condition. An indication of compromise is to check DDOS LACP violations: user@device> show ddos-protection protocols statistics brief | match lacp This issue only affects the MX Series platforms with Trio-based MPC.
