            "description": "A traffic classification vulnerability in Juniper Networks Junos OS on the SRX Series Services Gateways may allow an attacker to bypass Juniper Deep Packet Inspection (JDPI) rules and access unauthorized networks or resources, when 'no-syn-check' is enabled on the device.  While JDPI correctly classifies out-of-state asymmetric TCP flows as the dynamic-application UNKNOWN, this classification is not provided to the policy module properly and hence traffic continues to use the pre-id-default-policy, which is more permissive, causing the firewall to allow traffic to be forwarded that should have been denied.\n\nThis issue only occurs when 'set security flow tcp-session no-syn-check' is configured on the device.\n\nThis issue affects Juniper Networks Junos OS on SRX Series:\n18.4 versions prior to 18.4R2-S10, 18.4R3-S10;\n19.1 versions prior to 19.1R3-S8;\n19.2 versions prior to 19.2R1-S8, 19.2R3-S4;\n19.3 versions prior to 19.3R3-S3;\n19.4 versions prior to 19.4R3-S5;\n20.1 versions prior to 20.1R3-S1;\n20.2 versions prior to 20.2R3-S2;\n20.3 versions prior to 20.3R3-S1;\n20.4 versions prior to 20.4R2-S2, 20.4R3;\n21.1 versions prior to 21.1R2-S2, 21.1R3;\n21.2 versions prior to 21.2R2.\n\nThis issue does not affect Juniper Networks Junos OS versions prior to 18.4R1.\n",
